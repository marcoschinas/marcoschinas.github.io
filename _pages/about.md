I am a DPhil student in Molecular and Cellular Medicine at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Professor Steve Sansom. I am funded by the Kennedy Institute, Balliol College, Clarendon, and Conahcyt. My research focuses on using omics data (single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, TCR-seq) to investigate the role of the immune system in the development of ankylosing spondylitis.

I have a Bachelor’s in Genomic Sciences from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I then worked as a research assistant at Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, where I applied computational biology and multi-omics approaches to study immune-mediated diseases. During this time, I focused on identifying relevant cell types involved in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis by integrating genetics and functional genomic datasets.
